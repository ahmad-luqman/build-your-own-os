# Specification: Critical Bug Fixes

**Version**: 1.0  
**Date**: January 3, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED  
**Owner**: Ahmad Luqman

## Overview

Fix two critical bugs preventing proper file system operations in MiniOS.

## User Stories

### Story 1: Output Redirection for Shell Commands
**As a** MiniOS user  
**I want** to redirect command output to files using `>`  
**So that** I can save command results for later use

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- ✅ `echo "text" > file.txt` writes to file, not console
- ✅ File is created with correct permissions
- ✅ File content matches the redirected output
- ✅ No console output when using redirection
- ✅ Works with all commands that support redirection

### Story 2: Block Device Registration
**As a** MiniOS kernel developer  
**I want** block devices to register without crashing  
**So that** the file system layer can use persistent storage

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- ✅ RAM disk creates successfully
- ✅ Block device registers without exceptions
- ✅ System boots completely after registration
- ✅ Block devices are accessible to file system
- ✅ No memory corruption or crashes

## Problem Statements

### Bug #1: Output Redirection Not Working
**Severity**: 🔴 Critical  
**Impact**: Users cannot save command output to files

**Current Behavior**:
```bash
/MiniOS> echo "Hello World" > test.txt
Hello World  ← Should NOT appear
/MiniOS> cat test.txt
(empty or error)  ← File not created or empty
```

**Expected Behavior**:
```bash
/MiniOS> echo "Hello World" > test.txt
(no output)  ← Correct!
/MiniOS> cat test.txt
Hello World  ← Content in file
```

**Root Cause**:
Parser removes redirection syntax (`>` and filename) from argv before calling echo command. Echo command has no way to know redirection was requested.

### Bug #2: Block Device Registration Crashes System
**Severity**: 🔴 Critical  
**Impact**: Cannot use persistent storage, file systems limited to RAM only

**Current Behavior**:
```
Creating RAM disk...
RAM disk: Registering device...
*** UNHANDLED EXCEPTION ***
Exception type: Synchronous Exception
PC (ELR_EL1): 0x00000000600003C5
System will halt.
```

**Expected Behavior**:
```
Creating RAM disk...
Registered block device: ramdisk0 (32KB)
RAM disk created successfully
(system continues booting)
```

**Root Cause**:
Compiler optimization reordering struct field initialization, causing struct to be in inconsistent state during registration.

## Solution Specifications

### Solution #1: Shell Context Communication

**Approach**: Add redirection state to shell context for parser-to-command communication.

**Requirements**:
1. Add `output_redirect_file` field to `shell_context` structure
2. Parser detects `>` operator and stores filename in context
3. Parser removes redirection syntax from command argv
4. Commands check context for redirection before outputting
5. Commands write to file when redirection is active
6. Context is cleared after command execution

**Files to Modify**:
- `src/include/shell.h` - Add context field
- `src/shell/core/shell_core.c` - Initialize field
- `src/shell/parser/parser.c` - Detect and store redirection
- `src/shell/commands/builtin.c` - Check context, write to file

**API Changes**:
```c
struct shell_context {
    // ... existing fields ...
    char *output_redirect_file;  // NULL if no redirection
};
```

### Solution #2: Volatile Fields and Compiler Barriers

**Approach**: Prevent compiler optimization issues using industry-standard techniques.

**Requirements**:
1. Mark statistics fields as `volatile` in block_device struct
2. Add compiler barrier macros to kernel.h
3. Place barriers at strategic points in initialization
4. Ensure memory operations complete before proceeding

**Files to Modify**:
- `src/include/kernel.h` - Add barrier() macro
- `src/include/block_device.h` - Make fields volatile
- `src/fs/block/block_device.c` - Add barriers
- `src/fs/block/ramdisk.c` - Add barriers

**API Changes**:
```c
// Compiler barriers
#define barrier() __asm__ __volatile__("" ::: "memory")

// Volatile statistics
struct block_device {
    volatile uint64_t reads;
    volatile uint64_t writes;
    volatile uint64_t bytes_read;
    volatile uint64_t bytes_written;
};
```

## Success Metrics

### Functional Metrics:
- ✅ Output redirection test passes 100%
- ✅ Block device registration succeeds 100%
- ✅ System boots without crashes
- ✅ All file operations work correctly

### Quality Metrics:
- ✅ No performance regression
- ✅ Code follows industry best practices
- ✅ Solutions are maintainable and clear
- ✅ Comprehensive testing completed

### Documentation Metrics:
- ✅ TODO.md updated with fix details
- ✅ Test logs captured and saved
- ✅ Technical explanation documented
- ✅ Git commits are descriptive

## Constraints

### Technical Constraints:
- Must work with `-O2` optimization level
- Cannot break existing functionality
- Must be cross-platform (ARM64 and x86-64)
- Zero runtime overhead preferred

### Resource Constraints:
- No additional dependencies
- Minimal code changes
- Use existing kernel infrastructure

## Assumptions

1. RAMFS is available as fallback during testing
2. QEMU ARM64 environment is available for testing
3. Standard C compiler barriers are supported
4. volatile keyword works as expected

## Dependencies

### Bug #1 Dependencies:
- Shell parser implementation
- VFS file operations
- File descriptor system

### Bug #2 Dependencies:
- Memory allocator (kmalloc)
- Block device subsystem
- Compiler supports `volatile` and asm barriers

## Risks and Mitigations

### Risk: Solution might not work across compilers
**Mitigation**: Use standard C techniques (volatile, barriers) that work universally

### Risk: Barriers might affect performance
**Mitigation**: Barriers are compile-time only, zero runtime overhead

### Risk: Changes might break other functionality
**Mitigation**: Comprehensive testing of all file operations and phases

## Testing Strategy

### Test Cases for Bug #1:
1. Basic echo redirection: `echo "test" > file.txt`
2. Multiple redirections in sequence
3. Redirection with various commands
4. File overwrite behavior
5. Permission and error handling

### Test Cases for Bug #2:
1. RAM disk creation and registration
2. System boot with block device active
3. File operations using block device
4. Multiple block device registration
5. Long-running stability test

### Verification:
- Automated QEMU boot test
- Manual interactive testing
- File content verification
- Memory leak checks
