## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Build the OS
make clean && make ARCH=arm64 all

# Run it
qemu-system-aarch64 -machine virt -cpu cortex-a72 -m 512M \
    -kernel build/arm64/kernel.elf -nographic -serial mon:stdio

# You'll see:
# MiniOS Shell v1.0
# Type 'help' for available commands
# 
# /MiniOS> _
```

Try commands:
```
help    - Show all commands
echo    - Print text
pwd     - Show directory
ps      - List processes  
free    - Show memory
exit    - Exit shell
```

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Architecture
- **Shell Framework**: Clean separation between shell core and commands
- **Command Registry**: Table-driven command dispatch
- **Memory Management**: Heap-allocated context (~4KB)
- **Parser**: Supports arguments and basic option parsing
- **I/O**: Direct UART read/write with echo and line editing

### Key Files

```

### Memory Footprint
- Shell Context: ~4KB (heap-allocated)
- Code Size: ~15KB
- Stack Usage: Minimal (<1KB)
- Total Memory: ~16KB

## 🐛 Known Limitations

### Current Phase
1. **File operations are simulated** - Need Phase 5 VFS integration
2. **Process info is simulated** - Need real process manager queries
3. **History limited to 2 commands** - Size optimization
4. **No I/O redirection yet** - Planned for Phase 7
5. **No piping yet** - Planned for Phase 7

### By Design (Not Bugs)
- VFS not fully integrated (temporary)
- FD table NULL (works without it)
- Simulated data for ps/free (until Phase B integration)

## 🎓 Lessons Learned

### Memory Management
- Large structures (>4KB) need careful allocation
- Heap allocation is safer than BSS for dynamic structures
- Structure size directly impacts system stability

### Shell Design
- Table-driven command dispatch is clean and extensible
- Separation of parsing and execution improves testability
- Direct UART I/O is simple but effective for early phases

### Debugging
- Granular debug output pinpoints exact failure points
- Incremental testing catches issues early
- Cross-platform testing reveals architecture-specific issues

## 📞 Getting Help

### Common Issues

**Issue: Shell doesn't boot**
```bash
# Solution
make clean && make ARCH=arm64 all
```

**Issue: Exception at startup**
```bash
# Check SHELL_HISTORY_SIZE
grep SHELL_HISTORY_SIZE src/include/shell.h
# Should be 2
```

**Issue: Commands don't work**
```bash
# Rebuild from scratch
make clean && make ARCH=arm64 all
```

See `PHASE6_TESTING_GUIDE.md` for detailed troubleshooting.
