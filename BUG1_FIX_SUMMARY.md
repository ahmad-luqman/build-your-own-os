# Bug #1 Fix: Echo Output Redirection

**Status:** ✅ FIXED  
**Date:** January 2025  
**Bug Report:** See URGENT_BUGS_TEST_REPORT.md

## Problem Description

When user typed `echo Hello > file.txt`, the text "Hello" was printed to console instead of being written to the file. The file was either not created or remained empty.

## Root Cause

The shell parser and echo command were not properly communicating about output redirection:

1. Parser would detect `>` symbol and set `cmd->output_redirect = "file.txt"`
2. Parser would then **remove** `>` and `file.txt` from the argv array
3. Parser would call `cmd_echo` with only `["echo", "Hello"]`
4. `cmd_echo` would look for `>` in argv... but it was already removed!
5. `cmd_echo` would fall through to normal echo and print to console

## Solution

Added a new field `output_redirect_file` to `shell_context` so the parser can communicate redirection info to commands:

### Changes Made

#### 1. Updated `shell_context` structure (src/include/shell.h)
```c
struct shell_context {
    // ... existing fields ...
    
    // Output redirection (set by parser, used by commands)
    char *output_redirect_file;     // File for output redirection (NULL if none)
    
    // ... rest of fields ...
};
```

#### 2. Initialize new field (src/shell/core/shell_core.c)
```c
int shell_init(struct shell_context *ctx) {
    // ... existing initialization ...
    
    ctx->output_redirect_file = NULL;
    
    // ... rest of initialization ...
}
```

#### 3. Set field in parser (src/shell/parser/parser.c)
```c
int execute_command(struct shell_context *ctx, struct command_line *cmd) {
    // Store output redirection in context so commands can access it
    char *saved_output_redirect = ctx->output_redirect_file;
    ctx->output_redirect_file = cmd->output_redirect;
    
    // Execute command...
    int result = execute_builtin_command(ctx, cmd);
    
    // Restore context
    ctx->output_redirect_file = saved_output_redirect;
    
    return result;
}
```

#### 4. Updated cmd_echo to check context (src/shell/commands/builtin.c)
```c
int cmd_echo(struct shell_context *ctx, int argc, char *argv[]) {
    // Check if output redirection is active (set by parser)
    if (ctx->output_redirect_file) {
        // Write to file instead of console
        const char *filename = ctx->output_redirect_file;
        
        // Build full path, open file, write content
        // ... (file writing code)
        
        return SHELL_SUCCESS;  // No console output
    } else {
        // Normal echo - print to console
        shell_print(argv[1]);
        shell_print("\n");
        return SHELL_SUCCESS;
    }
}
```

## Files Modified

1. `src/include/shell.h` - Added `output_redirect_file` field
2. `src/shell/core/shell_core.c` - Initialize `output_redirect_file` to NULL
3. `src/shell/parser/parser.c` - Set and restore `output_redirect_file` in execute_command
4. `src/shell/commands/builtin.c` - Check `ctx->output_redirect_file` instead of argv

## Testing

### Manual Test
```bash
# Start QEMU
qemu-system-aarch64 -M virt -cpu cortex-a72 -m 512M -nographic \
    -kernel build/arm64/bootloader.elf -serial mon:stdio

# In MiniOS shell:
MiniOS> ls
MiniOS> echo "Hello World" > test.txt
MiniOS> ls                           # Should see test.txt
MiniOS> cat test.txt                 # Should show "Hello World"
```

### Expected Behavior (FIXED)
- `echo "Hello World" > test.txt` produces NO console output
- `ls` shows test.txt in the listing
- `cat test.txt` displays "Hello World"

### Old Behavior (BUG)
- `echo "Hello World" > test.txt` would print "Hello World" to console
- File would be empty or not created
- `cat test.txt` would show nothing

## Build Verification

```bash
cd /Users/ahmadluqman/src/build-your-own-os
make clean
make ARCH=arm64
```

✅ Build successful: No compilation errors or warnings

## Additional Benefits

This fix provides infrastructure that can be extended to other commands in the future. Any command can now check `ctx->output_redirect_file` to see if output should be redirected. This makes it easier to implement redirection for other commands like `ls`, `ps`, etc.

## Future Enhancements

1. **Append Redirection (`>>`)**: Can be implemented by adding `append_mode` flag to context
2. **Input Redirection (`<`)**: Similar approach with `input_redirect_file`
3. **Pipe Support (`|`)**: Would need pipe buffer in context
4. **Stderr Redirection (`2>`)**: Add `error_redirect_file` to context

FIX: Output redirection for echo command (Bug #1)

Problem: echo Hello > file.txt printed to console instead of file

Root cause: Parser removed '>' from argv before cmd_echo could see it

Solution:
- Added output_redirect_file to shell_context
- Parser now stores redirection info in context
- cmd_echo checks context instead of argv
