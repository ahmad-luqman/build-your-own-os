## Technical Achievements

### Device Framework Architecture
```c
// Unified device interface
struct device {
    char name[64];
    uint32_t device_id, type, flags, state;
    struct device_driver *driver;
    void *private_data;
    uint64_t base_addr;
    uint32_t irq_num;
    // Architecture-specific extensions
};

// Driver operations
struct device_driver {
    const char *name, *version;
    uint32_t type, flags;
    struct device_id *id_table;
    // Lifecycle operations
    int (*probe)(struct device *dev);
    int (*init)(struct device *dev);
    // Device operations  
    int (*read/write/ioctl)(...);
    // Interrupt handling
    void (*interrupt_handler)(...);
};
```

### Timer Services Architecture
```c
// Cross-platform timer API
uint64_t timer_get_time_us(void);
uint32_t timer_create(uint32_t type, uint64_t interval_us, 
                     timer_callback_t callback, void *data);
int timer_enable_scheduler(void);

// Architecture-specific implementations
int arch_timer_init(void);
uint64_t arch_timer_get_frequency(void);
