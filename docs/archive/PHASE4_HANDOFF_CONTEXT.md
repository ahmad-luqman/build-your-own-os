### Working Directory:
```bash
cd /Users/ahmadluqman/src/build-your-own-os
```

## 🧪 **Phase Testing System**

### Phase 4 Testing (Current Issue):
```bash
# Build Phase 4 kernel (device drivers + system services)
make clean
make ARCH=arm64 CFLAGS_EXTRA="-DPHASE_4_ONLY" kernel

# Test in QEMU (encounters synchronous exception)
./test_phase_4.sh

# Manual test with longer timeout
timeout 60 qemu-system-aarch64 \
    -machine virt \
    -cpu cortex-a72 \
    -m 512M \
    -kernel build/arm64/kernel.elf \
    -nographic \
    -serial mon:stdio
```

### Working Baseline (Phase 3):
```bash
# Build and test working Phase 3 baseline
make ARCH=arm64 CFLAGS_EXTRA="-DPHASE_3_ONLY" kernel
./test_phase_3.sh  # This works perfectly
```

## 🔍 **Known Issue Details**

### Exception Information:
```
✅ Phase 3: Memory management initialized
✅ Exception handling initialized  
✅ Memory allocation test: PASS
✅ Phase 4: Initializing device drivers and system services...
✅ Initializing device subsystem...
✅ Driver subsystem initialized
✅ ARM64: Initializing device tree discovery
✅ ARM64: Scanning for devices
❌ *** UNHANDLED EXCEPTION ***
❌ Exception type: Synchronous Exception
❌ PC (ELR_EL1): 0x00000000800003C5  <-- Unusual high address
❌ SP: 0x00000000400803E8           <-- Within kernel physical space
❌ System will halt.
```

### Analysis:
1. **Exception Type**: Synchronous Exception (likely memory access fault)
2. **PC Address**: 0x800003C5 (suspicious - possible virtual address issue)
3. **Timing**: Occurs during ARM64 device tree scanning
4. **Context**: All Phase 3 components working perfectly before this

## 🎯 **Investigation Focus Areas**

### 1. Device Tree Access Issues
**Primary Suspect**: `src/arch/arm64/device_discovery.c`
- Device tree base address validation
- Memory mapping requirements for device tree access
- QEMU virt machine device tree location and structure
- Virtual vs physical address confusion in device tree scanning

### 2. Memory Management Integration
**MMU Impact**: Phase 3 has MMU configured but disabled
- Device tree may require specific memory mapping
- Virtual address translation issues
- Memory access patterns in device scanning
- MMU enablement requirements for device access

### 3. Exception Context Analysis
**PC Address Investigation**: 0x800003C5 pattern suggests:
- Possible virtual address space confusion
- Function pointer or jump table issue
- Memory layout problem with device driver code
- Stack corruption or return address issue

### 4. QEMU Environment Factors
**Device Tree Layout**: QEMU virt machine specifics
- Device tree base address in QEMU
- Expected device entries and structure
- Memory layout provided by QEMU
- Device register access patterns

## 📁 **Key Files for Investigation**

### Primary Focus:
```bash
src/arch/arm64/device_discovery.c         # Device tree scanning logic (MAIN ISSUE)
src/kernel/device.c                       # Device subsystem initialization
src/kernel/driver.c                       # Driver framework
src/arch/arm64/interrupts/handlers.c      # Exception handler details
```

### Supporting Context:
```bash
src/include/device.h                      # Device management interfaces
src/arch/arm64/include/device.h           # ARM64 device definitions  
src/drivers/timer/arm64_timer.c          # Timer driver implementation
src/drivers/uart/pl011.c                 # UART driver implementation
src/drivers/interrupt/gic.c              # Interrupt controller driver
```

### Memory Management Foundation (Working):
```bash
src/kernel/memory.c                       # Cross-platform memory API
src/arch/arm64/memory/mmu.c              # ARM64 MMU (configured, disabled)
src/arch/arm64/memory/allocator.c        # Physical memory allocator
```

## 🚀 **Success Criteria**

### Phase 4 Should Complete:
```
Phase 4: Initializing device drivers and system services...
Initializing device subsystem...
Driver subsystem initialized
ARM64: Initializing device tree discovery
ARM64: Scanning for devices
Device tree analysis complete              <-- Target
Timer subsystem initialized                <-- Target
UART subsystem initialized                <-- Target  
Interrupt subsystem initialized           <-- Target
Process management initialized            <-- Target
Scheduler initialized                     <-- Target

=== PHASE 4 TESTING COMPLETE ===         <-- Target
Phase 4 operational...                   <-- Target (in loop)
```

## 💡 **Debugging Strategy**

### Step 1: Isolate Device Tree Access
Add granular logging to device discovery:
```c
// In src/arch/arm64/device_discovery.c
early_print("Device tree: Starting discovery\n");
early_print("Device tree: Checking base address\n");  
early_print("Device tree: Validating structure\n");
// etc. - identify exact failure point
```

### Step 2: Investigate Memory Access Patterns  
Check for:
- Device tree base address validation
- Memory mapping requirements
- Virtual vs physical address usage
- MMU impact on device memory access

### Step 3: Exception Handler Enhancement
Improve exception reporting:
- Add fault address details (FAR_EL1)
- Show instruction that caused exception  
- Display memory mapping state
- Check if MMU needs to be enabled

### Step 4: QEMU Device Tree Analysis
Verify QEMU environment:
- Check device tree structure in QEMU virt machine
- Validate expected device entries
- Confirm device tree accessibility
- Test device register access patterns

3. **System services** start correctly (process management, scheduler)  
4. **Exception handling** works properly with device drivers
5. **System progresses** to Phase 5 testing (file system)
