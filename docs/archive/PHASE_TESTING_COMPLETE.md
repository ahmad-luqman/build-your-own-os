## 🔧 How to Test Each Phase

### Phase 1: Foundation Testing
```bash
# Test build system
make clean
make ARCH=arm64 kernel    # Should build 173KB kernel.elf
make ARCH=x86_64 kernel   # Should build 118KB kernel.elf

# Verify cross-compilation working
file build/arm64/kernel.elf   # Should show: ARM aarch64
file build/x86_64/kernel.elf # Should show: x86-64
```

### Phase 2: Bootloader Testing  
```bash
# Create bootable images
make ARCH=arm64 all       # Creates 16MB minios.img
make ARCH=x86_64 all      # Creates 484KB minios.iso

# Verify bootable
ls -lh build/arm64/minios.img   # 16MB ARM64 image
ls -lh build/x86_64/minios.iso # 484KB x86_64 ISO
```

### Phase 3: Runtime Testing
```bash
# ARM64 Runtime Test (WORKS)
qemu-system-aarch64 \
    -machine virt \
    -cpu cortex-a72 \
    -m 512M \
    -kernel build/arm64/kernel.elf \
    -nographic \
    -serial mon:stdio

# x86_64 Runtime Test  
qemu-system-x86_64 \
    -machine q35 \
    -m 512M \
    -cdrom build/x86_64/minios.iso \
    -nographic \
    -serial mon:stdio
```
