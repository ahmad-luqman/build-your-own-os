## 🎯 Key Concepts

Understanding these concepts will help you navigate the documentation:

1. **VFS (Virtual File System)**: Abstraction layer that provides a unified interface
2. **File System Type**: Definition of a file system (like a class)
3. **File System Instance**: A mounted file system (like an object)
4. **Inode**: Metadata about a file or directory
5. **File Descriptor**: Integer handle for an open file
6. **Mount Point**: Path where a file system is attached
7. **Block Device**: Hardware storage abstraction
8. **Operations Table**: Function pointers for file system operations
