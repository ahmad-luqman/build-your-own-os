# MiniOS Context Preservation System

## Overview

The MiniOS project uses a comprehensive context preservation system to maintain continuity across development sessions. This system ensures that each new session has complete information about the project's current state, previous accomplishments, and next steps.

## Context File Structure

### 1. **Session Prompts** (Forward-Looking)
These files provide complete context for starting a new development session on a specific phase.

#### `PHASE{N}_SESSION_PROMPT.md`
- **Purpose**: Complete session initialization for Phase N
- **Size**: ~18KB (comprehensive context)
- **Contents**:
  - Complete project overview and current status
  - What's already complete (all previous phases)
  - Detailed Phase N goals and requirements
  - Technical implementation roadmap
  - Success criteria and testing strategies
  - Quick start commands and validation steps
  - Development approach and timeline

#### Example Files:
- `PHASE2_SESSION_PROMPT.md` (13KB) - Phase 2 bootloader implementation
- `PHASE3_SESSION_PROMPT.md` (19KB) - Phase 3 memory management & kernel loading

### 2. **Completion Handoffs** (Backward-Looking)
These files document what was accomplished in a completed session and provide transition information.

#### `PHASE{N}_COMPLETE_HANDOFF.md`
- **Purpose**: Complete summary of Phase N accomplishments
- **Size**: ~10KB (detailed completion summary)
- **Contents**:
  - Detailed accomplishments and implementations
  - Current system status and git repository state
  - Build artifacts and test coverage status
  - Technical implementation summary
  - Validation commands for verification
  - Next phase preparation and resources

#### Example Files:
- `PHASE1_COMPLETE.md` (6.6KB) - Phase 1 foundation setup completion
- `PHASE2_COMPLETE_HANDOFF.md` (10KB) - Phase 2 bootloader completion

### 3. **Legacy Session Summaries** (Historical)
These maintain historical context for reference.

#### `SESSION_HANDOFF_SUMMARY.md`
- **Purpose**: Historical session transition summary
- **Size**: ~5.5KB (concise summary)
- **Contents**:
  - High-level accomplishments
  - Current project status
  - Next session preparation
  - Key resources and references

## Context Preservation Workflow

### Phase Completion Process

#### 1. **During Development**
```bash
# Work is done in phase-specific branches
git checkout phase-N-feature-name
# ... implement features ...
git commit -m "Detailed implementation commits"
```

#### 2. **Upon Phase Completion**
```bash
# Create completion handoff document
vim PHASE{N}_COMPLETE_HANDOFF.md

# Document:
- All accomplishments and implementations
- Current system status (git, builds, tests)
- Technical details and file changes
- Validation commands
- Transition information for next phase
```

#### 3. **Merge and Release**
```bash
# Follow git branching strategy
git checkout develop
git merge phase-N-feature-name
git checkout main
git merge develop
git tag v0.N.0 -m "Phase N Complete: Description"
```

#### 4. **Next Phase Preparation**
```bash
# Create comprehensive session prompt for next phase
vim PHASE{N+1}_SESSION_PROMPT.md

# Include:
- Complete project context through Phase N
- Detailed Phase N+1 goals and requirements  
- Technical implementation roadmap
- Success criteria and testing approach
- Quick start commands and validation
```

### Session Initialization Process

#### 1. **New Session Startup**
```bash
# Start new session with context
cd /path/to/project
cat PHASE{N}_SESSION_PROMPT.md  # Read complete context

# Verify current state
git status                      # Check branch and changes
./tools/quick-test-phase{N-1}.sh # Verify previous phase works
```

#### 2. **Context Validation**
```bash
# Validate current project state matches context
git log --oneline -5            # Check recent commits
make clean && make ARCH=arm64   # Test build system
./tools/test-phase{N-1}.sh      # Verify test coverage
```

#### 3. **Branch Creation**
```bash
# Create development branch for new phase
git checkout -b phase-N-feature-name
git push -u origin phase-N-feature-name
```

## File Size and Content Guidelines

### Session Prompts (~18KB)
- **Comprehensive Context**: Complete project state through previous phases
- **Detailed Requirements**: Specific technical implementation goals
- **Implementation Roadmap**: Step-by-step development approach
- **Success Criteria**: Clear validation and testing requirements
- **Quick Start**: Commands to immediately verify and begin work

### Completion Handoffs (~10KB)
- **Accomplishment Summary**: What was completed in this session
- **Technical Details**: Files changed, implementations added, tests created
- **System Status**: Current git state, build artifacts, test coverage
- **Validation Commands**: How to verify everything works
- **Transition Info**: What the next session needs to know

### Context File Quality Standards

#### 1. **Completeness**
- All necessary context for independent session startup
- No assumptions about prior knowledge or context
- Complete command sequences for validation and development

#### 2. **Accuracy**
- Exact file paths, commit hashes, and command outputs
- Verified build artifacts and test results
- Current git branch structure and tag information

#### 3. **Actionability**
- Concrete next steps and development tasks
- Specific success criteria and validation methods
- Clear technical requirements and implementation approaches

## Context File Usage Patterns

### For Session Continuity
```bash
# Starting new session
cat PHASE{N}_SESSION_PROMPT.md          # Read complete context
git checkout phase-{N}-branch           # Switch to development branch
./tools/quick-test-phase{N-1}.sh       # Verify foundation works
# Begin implementation based on session prompt guidance
```

### For Project Onboarding
```bash
# Understanding project state
cat PHASE_PROGRESS_TRACKER.md          # Overall project status
cat PHASE{LATEST}_COMPLETE_HANDOFF.md  # Latest completion status
cat PHASE{NEXT}_SESSION_PROMPT.md      # Next development goals
```

### For Historical Reference
```bash
# Understanding project evolution
git log --oneline --graph --all         # Commit history
ls PHASE*_COMPLETE*.md                  # Completion summaries
ls PHASE*_SESSION*.md                   # Session contexts
```

## Context Validation System

### Automated Context Verification
```bash
# Verify context matches reality
./tools/validate-context.sh            # (Future: context validation tool)

# Manual verification commands in each session prompt:
git status                              # Branch and working tree state
git log --oneline -3                    # Recent commit history
make clean && make ARCH=arm64 all       # Build system validation
./tools/test-phase{N}.sh               # Test coverage validation
ls -lh build/*/*                       # Artifact verification
```

### Context Consistency Checks
- **Git State**: Branch structure matches documented expectations
- **Build System**: Artifacts can be created successfully
- **Test Coverage**: All documented tests pass as expected
- **File Structure**: All referenced files and directories exist

## Benefits of This System

### 1. **Seamless Session Transitions**
- Complete project context preserved across sessions
- No knowledge loss between development periods
- Immediate productivity without ramp-up time

### 2. **Independent Session Capability**
- Each session can be started independently
- No dependencies on previous session memory
- Complete validation and verification possible

### 3. **Project Continuity**
- Consistent development approach across phases
- Maintained quality standards and testing coverage
- Professional project management and documentation

### 4. **Onboarding and Collaboration**
- New developers can understand complete project state
- Historical context preserved for learning and reference
- Clear development patterns and standards established

└── Git: v0.1.0 tag

Session 2: Phase 2 Implementation  
├── Start: Read PHASE2_SESSION_PROMPT.md
├── Verify: Phase 1 tests still pass
├── Work: Bootloader enhancement
├── End: Create PHASE2_COMPLETE_HANDOFF.md + PHASE3_SESSION_PROMPT.md
└── Git: v0.2.0 tag

Session 3: Phase 3 Implementation
├── Start: Read PHASE3_SESSION_PROMPT.md
├── Verify: Phase 1+2 tests still pass
├── Work: Memory management & kernel loading

└── Git: v0.3.0 tag

[Pattern continues for all phases...]
```
