# MiniOS - A Learning Operating System

A minimal operating system project designed for educational purposes, supporting ARM64 and x86-64 architectures.

## Project Overview

This project aims to build a minimal operating system from scratch that can:
- Boot on ARM64 (for UTM on macOS) and x86-64 architectures
- Provide a basic shell interface
- Run simple CLI applications
- Serve as a learning platform for OS development concepts

## Current Status

ðŸš§ **Project is in planning phase**

## Architecture Support

- **Primary Target**: ARM64 (AArch64) for UTM Virtual Machine on macOS
- **Secondary Target**: x86-64 for broader compatibility
- Cross-platform build system using abstraction layers

## Features (Planned)

- [x] Project planning and documentation
- [ ] Bootloader (UEFI and Legacy BIOS support)
- [ ] Kernel initialization
- [ ] Memory management
- [ ] Process management
- [ ] File system (simple FAT32)
- [ ] Device drivers (keyboard, display)
- [ ] Shell implementation
- [ ] Basic CLI utilities
