# MiniOS - A Learning Operating System

A minimal operating system project designed for educational purposes, supporting ARM64 and x86-64 architectures.

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ahmadluqman/build-your-own-os.git
cd build-your-own-os

# Check prerequisites and setup
./tools/check-prerequisites.sh

# Build and test
make clean all
make test
```

## ðŸ“– Documentation

**Start here:** [docs/README.md](docs/README.md) - Complete documentation and guides

**New developers:** [docs/GETTING_STARTED.md](docs/GETTING_STARTED.md) - Setup and first build

## Current Status

ðŸŽ‰ **Phase 5 Complete - File System Implementation**

âœ… **5 of 7 phases complete** (71% progress)
âœ… **Complete operating system** with file system support
âœ… **Cross-platform** ARM64 (UTM) and x86-64 (QEMU) support

## Architecture Support

- **Primary Target**: ARM64 (AArch64) for UTM Virtual Machine on macOS
- **Secondary Target**: x86-64 for broader compatibility
- Cross-platform build system using abstraction layers

## Features (Implemented)

- [x] **Phase 1**: Foundation Setup - Cross-platform build system and development tools
- [x] **Phase 2**: Bootloader Implementation - UEFI (ARM64) and Multiboot2 (x86-64) 
- [x] **Phase 3**: Memory Management - MMU/Paging with virtual memory and allocation
- [x] **Phase 4**: System Services - Device drivers, processes, interrupts, system calls
- [x] **Phase 5**: File System - VFS layer, SFS implementation, block devices, file I/O
- [ ] **Phase 6**: User Interface - Shell implementation and CLI utilities  
- [ ] **Phase 7**: Polish & Documentation - Final optimizations and comprehensive guides
