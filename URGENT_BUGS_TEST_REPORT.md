## Bug #1: Output Redirection Broken

### Status: **CONFIRMED CRITICAL**

### Description
When user types `echo Hello > file.txt`, the text "Hello" goes to the console instead of being written to the file.

### Root Cause Analysis

**Location:** Parser and Echo command interaction

**The Problem:**
1. User types: `echo Hello > file.txt`
2. Parser (`src/shell/parser/parser.c` lines 36-52):
   - Detects `>` symbol
   - Sets `cmd->output_redirect = "file.txt"`
   - **REMOVES** `>` and `file.txt` from argv array
   - Passes only `["echo", "Hello"]` to cmd_echo

3. Echo command (`src/shell/commands/builtin.c` lines 428-499):
   - Looks for `>` in argv array (line 438)
   - Doesn't find it (because parser removed it!)
   - Falls through to normal echo (line 488)
   - Prints to console instead of file

**Evidence:**
```c
// parser.c line 46-50 - REMOVES redirection from arguments
if (i + 1 < cmd->argument_count) {
    cmd->output_redirect = cmd->arguments[i + 1];
    // Remove redirection from arguments  <-- THE BUG
    for (int j = i; j < cmd->argument_count - 2; j++) {
        cmd->arguments[j] = cmd->arguments[j + 2];
    }
```

```c
// builtin.c line 436-442 - Looks for what parser removed
int redirect_index = -1;
for (int i = 1; i < argc; i++) {
    if (strcmp(argv[i], ">") == 0) {  // Never found!
        redirect_index = i;
        break;
    }
}
```

### Impact
- File creation via `echo > file` is broken
- Cannot write content to files from shell
- Phase 6 shell functionality severely limited

### Fix Required
**Option A:** Make cmd_echo check `cmd->output_redirect` instead of argv  
**Option B:** Don't remove redirection from argv in parser  
**Option C:** Use the parser's setup_io_redirection() properly

**Recommended:** Option A - cmd_echo should use the parsed command_line structure

## Bug #2: Block Device Registration Crashes

### Status: **CONFIRMED CRITICAL**

### Description
RAM disk creation causes crashes during block_device_register, so it has been disabled.

### Root Cause Analysis

**Location:** `src/kernel/main.c` line 317-325

**Evidence:**
```c
// main.c line 317-325
// TODO: RAM disk has issues with block_device_register - skip for now
// Creating RAM disk...
early_print("RAM disk: SKIPPED (block_device_register issue)\n");
// struct block_device *ramdisk = ramdisk_create("ramdisk0", 4 * 1024 * 1024);
// if (ramdisk) {
//     early_print("RAM disk created successfully\n");
// } else {
//     early_print("Warning: RAM disk creation failed\n");
// }
```

**The Problem:**
The ramdisk_create() function in `src/fs/block/ramdisk.c` calls block_device_register() at line 148, but this has been causing crashes. The code was commented out to prevent system failure.

**Potential Issues:**
1. Memory allocation timing - ramdisk created before allocator fully ready
2. Block device manager not properly initialized
3. Race condition in device registration
4. Memory corruption in block_device_register linked list manipulation

**Debug Evidence:**
The ramdisk.c has extensive debug prints (lines 115-156) that were added to track down where crashes occur:
- "RAM disk: About to memset..."
- "RAM disk: Setting up private data..."
- "RAM disk: Registering device..."

### Impact
- Cannot test SFS (Simple File System) without block device
- Block device layer untested
- Phase 5 incomplete

### Fix Required
1. Investigate block_device_register() for memory corruption
2. Check linked list manipulation in device registration
3. Verify memory allocator state when ramdisk_create is called
4. Add proper synchronization if needed

## Bug #3: Relative Path Handling

### Status: **CONFIRMED BUT MITIGATED**

### Description
vfs_resolve_path() does not actually resolve relative paths, it just copies the input path.

### Root Cause Analysis

**Location:** `src/fs/vfs/vfs_core.c` lines 402-419

**Evidence:**
```c
char *vfs_resolve_path(const char *path)
{
    if (!path) {
        return NULL;
    }
    
    // Simple implementation: return a copy of the path
    // In a full implementation, this would resolve relative paths,
    // symbolic links, etc.
    
    size_t path_len = strlen(path);
    char *resolved = kmalloc(path_len + 1);
    if (resolved) {
        strcpy(resolved, path);  // Just copies, doesn't resolve!
    }
    
    return resolved;
}
```

**The Comment Says It All:** "Simple implementation: return a copy of the path"

### Why It's Not Breaking Everything

Shell commands work around this using `build_full_path()` helper function in `src/shell/commands/builtin.c` (lines 11-36):

```c
static void build_full_path(char *dest, size_t dest_size, 
                           const char *current_dir, const char *path)
{
    if (path[0] == '/') {
        // Absolute path - works fine
        strncpy(dest, path, dest_size - 1);
    } else {
        // Relative path - manually resolved
        // Concatenates current_dir + "/" + path
    }
}
```

### Impact
- **Low immediate impact** - Shell commands work around it
- **Medium long-term impact** - VFS API is incomplete
- Direct VFS API calls with relative paths will fail
- Symbolic links can't be resolved (not implemented anyway)

### Fix Required
Implement proper path resolution in vfs_resolve_path():
1. Handle "." (current directory)
2. Handle ".." (parent directory) 
3. Handle relative paths
4. Eventually: symbolic link resolution

## Testing Recommendations

### For Bug #1 (Output Redirection)
```bash
# Test case 1: Basic redirection
echo "Hello World" > test.txt
cat test.txt
# Expected: "Hello World"
# Actual: test.txt is empty OR not created, "Hello World" on console

# Test case 2: Multiple words
echo This is a test > test2.txt
cat test2.txt
# Expected: "This is a test"
# Actual: Broken
```

### For Bug #2 (Block Device)
Currently disabled - would need to:
1. Uncomment lines 320-325 in src/kernel/main.c
2. Boot the system
3. Observe where crash occurs (debug prints should help)

### For Bug #3 (Relative Paths)
```bash
# Test case 1: Relative path in VFS call
cd /
mkdir testdir
cd testdir
# Try relative path operations
echo "test" > ./file.txt  # Should work via build_full_path
cat ./file.txt            # Should work
```

## Priority and Recommended Fix Order

### 1. Fix Bug #1 (Output Redirection) - URGENT
- **Difficulty:** Easy (30 minutes)
- **Impact:** High - Enables file creation from shell
- **Fix:** Modify cmd_echo to use cmd->output_redirect

### 2. Fix Bug #3 (Path Resolution) - MEDIUM
- **Difficulty:** Medium (2-3 hours)
- **Impact:** Medium - Improves VFS robustness
- **Fix:** Implement proper path resolution algorithm

### 3. Investigate Bug #2 (Block Device) - COMPLEX
- **Difficulty:** Hard (4-8 hours debugging)
- **Impact:** High - Needed for SFS testing
- **Fix:** Debug memory corruption, timing, or race condition

---

## Conclusion

All three urgent bugs are real and confirmed. The output redirection bug (#1) should be fixed first as it's easy and high-impact. The block device issue (#2) needs careful debugging. The path resolution issue (#3) is less urgent since shell commands work around it.

**Next Steps:**
1. Get user confirmation to proceed with fixes
2. Implement fixes in order of priority
3. Test each fix thoroughly
4. Update TODO.md with completed items
