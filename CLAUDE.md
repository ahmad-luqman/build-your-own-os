This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

MiniOS is an educational operating system project supporting ARM64 and x86-64 architectures. The project follows a phased development approach with 7 main phases, currently at Phase 5 completion (File System Implementation). This is a learning OS designed to demonstrate core OS concepts clearly.

## Build Commands

### Basic Build Operations
```bash
# Build for ARM64 (default)
make

# Build for x86-64
make ARCH=x86_64

# Clean build artifacts
make clean

# Build and test in VM
make test

# Build debug version with symbols and logging
make DEBUG=1

# Display build information
make info

# Quick build and test
make quick-test
```

### Testing Commands
```bash
# Phase-specific testing
./tools/test-phase1.sh      # Phase 1 foundation testing
./tools/test-phase3.sh      # Phase 3 memory testing
./tools/test-phase4.sh      # Phase 4 system services testing

# Multi-phase testing
./test_phases.sh            # Test all completed phases
./test_all_phases.sh        # Comprehensive testing
./demo_phases_12.sh         # Demo phases 1-2

# Debug session
make debug                  # Start debug session
```

## Architecture

### Cross-Platform Support
- **Primary Target**: ARM64 (AArch64) for UTM Virtual Machine on macOS
- **Secondary Target**: x86-64 for broader compatibility via QEMU
- **Build System**: Uses GNU Make with architecture-specific configuration files in `tools/build/arch-*.mk`

### Key Architectural Patterns
1. **Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL)**: Clean separation between architecture-specific and independent code
2. **Microkernel-inspired design**: Minimal kernel with modular components
3. **Phase-based development**: Each phase builds upon previous functionality

### Source Code Structure

## Current Implementation Status

**Phase 5 Complete - File System Implementation**
- ‚úÖ Phase 1: Foundation Setup - Cross-platform build system
- ‚úÖ Phase 2: Bootloader Implementation - UEFI (ARM64) and Multiboot2 (x86-64)
- ‚úÖ Phase 3: Memory Management - MMU/Paging with virtual memory
- ‚úÖ Phase 4: System Services - Device drivers, processes, interrupts, syscalls
- ‚úÖ Phase 5: File System - VFS layer, SFS implementation, block devices
- üîÑ Phase 6: User Interface - Shell implementation and CLI utilities
- ‚è≥ Phase 7: Polish & Documentation

## Development Workflow

### Cross-Compilation Setup
The build system automatically selects appropriate toolchains:
- **ARM64**: `aarch64-elf-gcc`, `aarch64-elf-ld`, `aarch64-elf-as`
- **x86-64**: `x86_64-elf-gcc`, `x86_64-elf-ld`, `nasm`

### Build Process
1. Architecture detection and toolchain selection
2. Source file compilation with architecture-specific flags
3. Linking using architecture-specific linker scripts
4. Bootloader build and image creation
5. VM testing and debugging

### Key Files to Understand
- `Makefile`: Main build configuration
- `src/kernel/kernel.h`: Core kernel structures and interfaces
- `src/include/`: Central header definitions
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`: Detailed system architecture
- `docs/BUILD.md`: Build system documentation

## Important Implementation Details

### Memory Management
- Virtual memory with 4KB pages
- 4-level page tables on both architectures
- User/kernel space separation
- ARM64: 256TB address spaces, x86-64: 128TB address spaces

### System Call Interface
- ARM64: `svc #0` instruction, arguments in x0-x5, return in x0
- x86-64: `syscall` instruction, arguments in rdi, rsi, rdx, rcx, r8, r9, return in rax

### File System
- VFS abstraction layer supporting multiple file systems
- SFS (Simple File System) implementation
- Block device abstraction for storage

### Process Management
- Round-robin scheduling with priority levels
- Preemptive multitasking via timer interrupts
- Process structures with virtual memory spaces

## Debugging and Development Tips

### Debug Builds
Use `make DEBUG=1` for:
- Debug symbols (-g)
- No optimization (-O0)
- Debug logging enabled (-DDEBUG)
- Log level set to DEBUG (0)

### VM Testing
- ARM64: Uses UTM-compatible disk images (.img)
- x86-64: Uses ISO images (.iso)
- Default timeout: 30 seconds for automated testing

### Common Development Tasks
- When adding new kernel features: Update appropriate files in `src/kernel/`
- Architecture-specific changes: Modify files in `src/arch/<arch>/`
- New device drivers: Add to `src/drivers/` with appropriate abstractions
- User applications: Add to `src/userland/` and update Makefile targets
