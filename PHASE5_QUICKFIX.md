# Phase 5 Quick Fix Plan

## Issue
Memory allocation (kmalloc/memory_alloc) causes exceptions during early boot.

## Solution
Comment out dynamic allocations temporarily and document where they're needed:

### 1. Disable FD Init (DONE)
Already commented out in main.c

### 2. Disable RAM Disk Creation (TEMPORARY)
Comment out ramdisk_create() call until memory allocator is stable

### 3. Create Static RAMFS Mount (WORKAROUND)
Mount RAMFS without actual RAM disk device - it doesn't need one!

### 4. Test Shell with Stub FS Operations
Shell commands will work with VFS stubs that return success

## Implementation

```c
// In main.c, replace RAM disk section with:
    // Mount RAMFS directly (doesn't need block device)
    early_print("Mounting RAMFS at root...\n");
    if (vfs_mount("none", "/", "ramfs", 0) == VFS_SUCCESS) {
        early_print("RAMFS mounted successfully\n");
        // Note: Cannot populate files yet due to memory allocator issues
        // Will work once kmalloc is stable
    }
```

This allows:
- VFS to initialize ✓
- RAMFS to register ✓  
- Basic mount to succeed ✓
- Shell to start ✓
- Commands to run (with stubs) ✓

## Next Developer Steps

1. Debug memory allocator initialization order
2. Ensure kmalloc works before Phase 5 init
3. Re-enable ramdisk_create()
4. Re-enable ramfs_populate_initial_files()
5. Re-enable fd_init()
6. Test full filesystem operations

## Commands Status

| Command | Works Now | Works After Fix |
|---------|-----------|-----------------|
| ls      | Stub (empty) | Full listing |
| cd      | Validation only | Full navigation |
| pwd     | Shows / | Shows current path |
| mkdir   | Stub (success) | Creates dir |
| cat     | Stub (empty) | Shows content |
| echo    | Works | Works |
| help    | Works | Works |
