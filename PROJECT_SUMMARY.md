## Development Plan Overview

### 🎯 Project Goals
Build a minimal, educational operating system that:
- ✅ Supports ARM64 (UTM on macOS) and x86-64 architectures
- ⏳ Provides basic memory and process management
- ⏳ Implements a simple shell interface  
- ⏳ Can run basic CLI applications
- ✅ Serves as a comprehensive learning platform

## Current Status

**Phase 5 Complete**: MiniOS now has a complete file system implementation including:

- ✅ **Virtual File System (VFS)** - Unified file operations interface with mount management
- ✅ **Block Device Layer** - Storage abstraction with RAM disk implementation
- ✅ **Simple File System (SFS)** - Educational filesystem with inodes and directories
- ✅ **File Descriptor Management** - Per-process file tables with POSIX-like operations
- ✅ **File I/O Operations** - Complete open, read, write, close, seek functionality
- ✅ **Directory Operations** - mkdir, rmdir, readdir with hierarchical navigation
- ✅ **Root Filesystem** - 1MB RAM disk mounted as SFS root filesystem
- ✅ **Cross-Platform Support** - Identical file system behavior on ARM64 and x86-64

**Next**: Phase 6 will implement user interface with shell and command-line utilities.

## Technical Architecture Highlights

### 🏗️ Cross-Platform Design
- **Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL)** for architecture independence
- **Unified build system** supporting ARM64 and x86-64
- **VM testing** on UTM (ARM64) and QEMU (both architectures)

### 💾 Memory Management
- **48-bit virtual address space** on both architectures
- **4KB page tables** with 4-level paging
- **Kernel/user space separation** with proper protection

### 🔄 Process Management  
- **Round-robin scheduling** with priority levels
- **Preemptive multitasking** (10ms time slices)
- **System call interface** for user programs

## Immediate Next Steps

### 🚀 Ready to Start Phase 1
1. **Install Prerequisites** (see [PREREQUISITES.md](docs/PREREQUISITES.md))
   ```bash
   # Install cross-compilation toolchain
   brew install aarch64-elf-gcc x86_64-elf-gcc
   brew install nasm qemu utm
   ```

2. **Implement Build System** (see [BUILD.md](docs/BUILD.md))
   - Create main Makefile
   - Add architecture-specific build configs
   - Implement build scripts and tools

3. **Set Up VM Environment** (see [VM_SETUP.md](docs/VM_SETUP.md))
   - Configure UTM for ARM64 testing
   - Set up QEMU for cross-platform testing
   - Create VM automation scripts

4. **Create Initial Test Kernel**
   - Minimal "Hello World" kernel for both architectures
   - Verify build system works end-to-end
   - Test in both VM environments

### 📚 Context for Future Sessions
