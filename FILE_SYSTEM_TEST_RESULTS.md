     - Format device with SFS
  
  2. **Block Allocation** ✓
     - Allocate blocks
     - Free blocks
     - Read/write blocks
     - Bitmap management
  
  3. **File Operations** ✓
     - sfs_file_open()
     - sfs_file_close()
     - sfs_file_read() - Full implementation with direct blocks
     - sfs_file_write() - Full implementation with direct blocks
     - sfs_file_seek()

- Superblock Mgmt:   ✓ COMPLETE
- Block Allocation:  ✓ COMPLETE
- File Operations:   ✓ COMPLETE
- Directory Ops:     ✓ COMPLETE

Block Device Integration: Awaiting block_device_register fix
```

## Implementation Details

### RAMFS Architecture
```
File Structure:
- In-memory tree structure
- Dynamic node allocation with kmalloc
- Parent-child relationships
- Sibling linked lists

Operations:
- Path resolution
- Node creation/destruction
- Child addition/removal
- Tree traversal
```

### SFS Architecture
```
On-Disk Layout:
Block 0:         Superblock
Blocks 1-7:      Block bitmap
Blocks 8-63:     Inode table
Blocks 64+:      Data blocks

File Storage:
- Direct blocks: 12 pointers (48KB max without indirect)
- Indirect block: 1 pointer (for larger files)
- Block size: 4096 bytes
```

## VFS Integration

### Registered File Systems
```
VFS Information:
  Filesystem types: 2
  Active mounts: 1
  Registered filesystems:
    sfs
    ramfs
  Mount points:
    / (ramfs)
```

### File Operations Interface
Both RAMFS and SFS implement the complete VFS interface:
- `struct file_operations` - open, close, read, write, seek, sync
- `struct directory_operations` - readdir, mkdir, rmdir, lookup
- `struct file_system_type` - mount, unmount, format

## Test Commands Used

```bash
# Build system
make kernel ARCH=arm64

# Run comprehensive test
./test_fs_comprehensive.sh

# Run RAMFS command test
./test_ramfs_commands.sh

# View test logs
cat serial-fs-comprehensive.log
cat serial-ramfs-commands.log
```

## Known Issues

1. **File Creation via Shell**
   - `touch` command not implemented
   - Output redirection (`echo > file`) needs work
   
2. **Block Device Integration**
   - RAM disk skipped due to block_device_register issue
   - SFS needs block device for full testing

3. **Path Resolution**
   - Relative paths need improvement
   - Some edge cases in path handling

## Conclusion

### RAMFS: ✅ FULLY FUNCTIONAL
All core features working:
- ✓ Mounting/unmounting
- ✓ File listing
- ✓ File reading
- ✓ Directory operations
- ✓ Path navigation

### SFS: ✅ FULLY IMPLEMENTED
All core components complete:
- ✓ Superblock management
- ✓ Block allocation
- ✓ File I/O operations
- ✓ Directory operations
- ⏸ Ready for block device integration

## Next Steps

1. Fix block_device_register for RAM disk support
2. Test SFS with actual block device
3. Implement file creation commands in shell
4. Add output redirection support
5. Improve relative path handling
6. Add more file operations (rename, stat, etc.)
